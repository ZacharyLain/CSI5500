# Lab 4
## Objective
Use sockets for network communication between a client and a server.

Develop a simple client-server application that allows a client to send a message to the server and the server to respond with an acknowledgment message.

Develop a multi-threaded server which allows multiple clients to connect to the server at the same time. The clients are able to send messages to the server until they close their connection.
